The app displays a scrambled word, and the player has to guess the word using all the letters shown. The player scores points if the word is correct. Otherwise, the player can try to guess the word any number of times. The app also has an option to skip the current word. In the top right corner, the app displays the word count, which is the number of scrambled words played in the current game. There are 10 scrambled words per game.
